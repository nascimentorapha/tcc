The present works proposes analyze and study through Artificial Intelligence and Linear Regression the relationship between the new's sentiment analysed through Twitter and the stock exchange variation value

## :information_source: Tutorial

* **1 Search Intraday** - In path codes, run **1_get-intraday.ipynb** to search the intraday company that you want and change the company code on Stock Market. E.g. Petrobras = PBR. Here we'll export the intraday data to csv.

* **2 Search Tweets** - Search tweets with Twitter API. We suggest to use the code made by Jefferson Henrique on this link (https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python). We'll export to a csv here too;

* **3 Proccess data** - Run **3_adjustTweetsDatetime.ipynb** to properly process tweet data for later concatenate with intraday;

* **4 Sentiment Analyze** - Run **4_vader_analyzer.ipynb** to read and process tweets that we get on **step 3**

* **5 Start Linear Regression** - In this step we'll process

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Results

In test development with Petrobras company on his Stock Market Values and tweets analisys, the results after a Linear Regression was satisfatory and the prediction line on chart is visible and regular as we can see below on red points.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/nascimentorapha/term-paper/blob/master/.github/result.JPG"/></p>

The correlationship between the stock market value variation and the sentiment generated by tweets was 55,02%.
